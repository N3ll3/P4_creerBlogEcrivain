(67, 'CHAP 1 - THE ALASKA INTERIOR ', '<p><em>April 27th, 1992 </em></p>\r\n<p><em>Greetings from Fairbanks! This is the last you shall hear from me Wayne. Arrived here 2 days ago. It was very difficult to catch rides in the Yukon Territory. But I finally got here. </em></p>\r\n<p><em>Please return all mail I receive to the sender. It might be a very long time before I return South. If this adventure proves fatal and you don&rsquo;t ever hear from me again I want you to know you &lsquo;re a great man. I now walk into the wild. Alex. P&nbsp;</em></p>\r\n<p>POSTCARD RECEIVED BY WAYNE WESTERBERG IN CARTHAGE, SOUTH DAKOTA</p>\r\n<p>Jim Gallien had driven four miles out of Fairbanks when he spotted the hitchhiker standing in the snow beside the road, thumb raised high, shivering in the gray Alaska dawn. He didn&rsquo;t appear to be very old: eighteen, maybe nineteen at most. A rifle protruded from the young man&rsquo;s backpack, but he looked friendly enough; a hitchhiker with a Remington semiautomatic isn&rsquo;t the sort of thing that gives motorists pause in the forty-ninth state. Gallien steered his truck onto the shoulder and told the kid to climb in. The hitchhiker swung his pack into the bed of the Ford and introduced himself as Alex. &ldquo;Alex?&rdquo; Gallien responded, fishing for a last name.</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;Just Alex,&rdquo; the young man replied, pointedly rejecting the bait. Five feet seven or eight with a wiry build, he claimed to be twenty-four years old and said he was from South Dakota. He explained that he wanted a ride as far as the edge of Denali National Park, where he intended to walk deep into the bush and &ldquo;live off the land for a few months.&rdquo; Gallien, a union electrician, was on his way to Anchorage, 240 miles beyond Denali on the George Parks Highway; he told Alex he&rsquo;d drop him off wherever he wanted. Alex&rsquo;s backpack looked as though it weighed only twenty-five or thirty pounds, which struck Gallien&mdash;an accomplished hunter and woodsman&mdash;as an improbably light load for a stay of several months in the back-country, especially so early in the spring. &ldquo;He wasn&rsquo;t carrying anywhere near as much food and gear as you&rsquo;d expect a guy to be carrying for that kind of trip,&rdquo; Gallien recalls. The sun came up. As they rolled down from the forested ridges above the Tanana River, Alex gazed across the expanse of windswept muskeg stretching to the south.</p>\r\n<p>Gallien wondered whether he&rsquo;d picked up one of those crackpots from the lower forty-eight who come north to live out ill-considered Jack London fantasies. Alaska has long been a magnet for dreamers and misfits, people who think the unsullied enormity of the Last Frontier will patch all the holes in their lives. The bush is an unforgiving place, however, that cares nothing for hope or longing. &ldquo;People from Outside,&rdquo; reports Gallien in a slow, sonorous drawl, &ldquo;they&rsquo;ll pick up a copy of Alaska magazine, thumb through it, get to thinkin&rsquo; &lsquo;Hey, I&rsquo;m goin&rsquo; to get on up there, live off the land, go claim me a piece of the good life.&rsquo; But when they get here and actually head out into the bush&mdash;well, it isn&rsquo;t like the magazines make it out to be. The rivers are big and fast. The mosquitoes eat you alive. Most places, there aren&rsquo;t a lot of animals to hunt. Livin&rsquo; in the bush isn&rsquo;t no picnic.&rdquo; It was a two-hour drive from Fairbanks to the edge of Denali Park. The more they talked, the less Alex struck Gallien as a nutcase. He was congenial and seemed well educated. He peppered Gallien with thoughtful questions about the kind of small game that live in the country, the kinds of berries he could eat&mdash; &rdquo;that kind of thing.&rdquo; Still, Gallien was concerned.</p>\r\n<p>Alex admitted that the only food in his pack was a ten-pound bag of rice. His gear seemed exceedingly minimal for the harsh conditions of the interior, which in April still lay buried under the winter snowpack. Alex&rsquo;s cheap leather hiking boots were neither waterproof nor well insulated. His rifle was only .22 caliber, a bore too small to rely on if he expected to kill large animals like moose and caribou, which he would have to eat if he hoped to remain very long in the country. He had no ax, no bug dope, no snowshoes, no compass. The only navigational aid in his possession was a tattered state road map he&rsquo;d scrounged at a gas station. A hundred miles out of Fairbanks the highway begins to climb into the foothills of the Alaska Range. As the truck lurched over a bridge across the Nenana River, Alex looked down at the swift current and remarked that he was afraid of the water. &ldquo;A year ago down in Mexico,&rdquo; he told Gallien, &ldquo;I was out on the ocean in a canoe, and I almost drowned when a storm came up.&rdquo; A little later Alex pulled out his crude map and pointed to a dashed red line that intersected the road near the coal-mining town of Healy. It represented a route called the Stampede Trail. Seldom traveled, it isn&rsquo;t even marked on most road maps of Alaska.</p>\r\n<p>On Alex&rsquo;s map, nevertheless, the broken line meandered west from the Parks Highway for forty miles or so before petering out in the middle of trackless wilderness north of Mt. McKinley. This, Alex announced to Gallien, was where he intended to go. Gallien thought the hitchhiker&rsquo;s scheme was foolhardy and tried repeatedly to dissuade him: &ldquo;I said the hunting wasn&rsquo;t easy where he was going, that he could go for days without killing any game. When that didn&rsquo;t work, I tried to scare him with bear stories. I told him that a twenty-two probably wouldn&rsquo;t do anything to a grizzly except make him mad. Alex didn&rsquo;t seem too worried. Til climb a tree&rsquo; is all he said. So I explained that trees don&rsquo;t grow real big in that part of the state, that a bear could knock down one of them skinny little black spruce without even trying. But he wouldn&rsquo;t give an inch. He had an answer for everything I threw at him.&rdquo; Gallien offered to drive Alex all the way to Anchorage, buy him some decent gear, and then drive him back to wherever he wanted to go. &ldquo;No, thanks anyway,&rdquo; Alex replied, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be fine with what I&rsquo;ve got.&rdquo; Gallien asked whether he had a hunting license. &ldquo;Hell, no,&rdquo; Alex scoffed. &ldquo;How I feed myself is none of the government&rsquo;s business. Fuck their stupid rules.&rdquo; When Gallien asked whether his parents or a friend knew what he was up to&mdash; whether there was anyone who would sound the alarm if he got into trouble and was overdue&mdash;Alex answered calmly that no, nobody knew of his plans, that in fact he hadn&rsquo;t spoken to his family in nearly two years. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m absolutely positive,&rdquo; he assured Gallien, &ldquo;I won&rsquo;t run into anything I can&rsquo;t deal with on my own.&rdquo; &ldquo;There was just no talking the guy out of it,&rdquo; Gallien remembers.</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;He was determined. Real gung ho. The word that comes to mind is excited. He couldn&rsquo;t wait to head out there and get started.&rdquo; Three hours out of Fairbanks, Gallien turned off the highway and steered his beat-up 4x4 down a snow-packed side road. For the first few miles the Stampede Trail was well graded and led past cabins scattered among weedy stands of spruce and aspen. Beyond the last of the log shacks, however, the road rapidly deteriorated. Washed out and overgrown with alders, it turned into a rough, unmaintained track. In summer the road here would have been sketchy but passable; now it was made unnavigable by a foot and a half of mushy spring snow.</p>\r\n<p>Ten miles from the highway, worried that he&rsquo;d get stuck if he drove farther, Gallien stopped his rig on the crest of a low rise. The icy summits of the highest mountain range in North America gleamed on the southwestern horizon. Alex insisted on giving Gallien his watch, his comb, and what he said was all his money: eighty-five cents in loose change. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want your money,&rdquo; Gallien protested, &ldquo;and I already have a watch.&rdquo; &ldquo;If you don&rsquo;t take it, I&rsquo;m going to throw it away,&rdquo; Alex cheerfully retorted. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to know what time it is. I don&rsquo;t want to know what day it is or where I am. None of that matters.&rdquo; Before Alex left the pickup, Gallien reached behind the seat, pulled out an old pair of rubber work boots, and persuaded the boy to take them. &ldquo;They were too big for him,&rdquo; Gallien recalls. &ldquo;But I said, &lsquo;Wear two pair of socks, and your feet ought to stay halfway warm and dry.&rsquo;&rdquo; &ldquo;How much do I owe you?&rdquo; &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry about it,&rdquo; Gallien answered.</p>\r\n<p>Then he gave the kid a slip of paper with his phone number on it, which Alex carefully tucked into a nylon wallet. &ldquo;If you make it out alive, give me a call, and I&rsquo;ll tell you how to get the boots back to me.&rdquo; Gallien&rsquo;s wife had packed him two grilled-cheese-and-tuna sandwiches and a bag of corn chips for lunch; he persuaded the young hitchhiker to accept the food as well. Alex pulled a camera from his backpack and asked Gallien to snap a picture of him shouldering his rifle at the trailhead. Then, smiling broadly, he disappeared down the snow-covered track. The date was Tuesday, April 28, 1992. Gallien turned the truck around, made his way back to the Parks Highway, and continued toward Anchorage. A few miles down the road he came to the small community of Healy, where the Alaska State Troopers maintain a post. Gallien briefly considered stopping and telling the authorities about Alex, then thought better of it. &ldquo;I figured he&rsquo;d be OK,&rdquo; he explains. &ldquo;I thought he&rsquo;d probably get hungry pretty quick and just walk out to the highway. That&rsquo;s what any normal person would do.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>', '2019-07-04 16:33:13', 1),
(68, ' CHAP  2 - THE STAMPEDE TRAIL \r\n', '<p><em>Jack London is King </em></p>\r\n<p><em>Alexander Supertramp </em></p>\r\n<p><em>May 1992 </em></p>\r\n<p>GRAFFITO CARVED INTO A PIECE OF WOOD DISCOVERED AT THE SITE OF CHRIS MCCANDLESS&rsquo;S DEATH</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>Dark spruce forest frowned on either side the frozen waterway. The trees had been stripped by a recent wind of their white covering of frost, and they seemed to lean toward each other, black and ominous, in the fading light. A vast silence reigned over the land. The land itself was a desolation, lifeless, without movement, so lone and cold that the spirit of it was not even that of sadness. There was a hint in it of laughter, but of a laughter more terrible than any sadness&mdash;a laughter that was mirthless as the smile of the Sphinx, a laughter cold as the frost and partaking of the grimness of infallibility. It was the masterful and incommunicable wisdom of eternity laughing at the futility of life and the effort of life. It was the Wild, the savage, frozenhearted Northland Wild. </em></p>\r\n<p>JACK LONDON, WHITE FANG</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;Mt. McKinley and its satellites surrender to the low Kantishna plain, a series of lesser ridges, known as the Outer Range, sprawls across the flats like a rumpled blanket on an unmade bed. Between the flinty crests of the two outermost escarpments of the Outer Range runs an east-west trough, maybe five miles across, carpeted in a boggy amalgam of muskeg, alder thickets, and veins of scrawny spruce.</p>\r\n<p>Meandering through the tangled, rolling bottomland is the Stampede Trail, the route Chris McCandless followed into the wilderness. The trail was blazed in the 1930s by a legendary Alaska miner named Earl Pilgrim; it led to antimony claims he&rsquo;d staked on Stampede Creek, above the Clearwater Fork of the Toklat River. In 1961, a Fairbanks company, Yutan Construction, won a contract from the new state of Alaska (statehood having been granted just two years earlier) to upgrade the trail, building it into a road on which trucks could haul ore from the mine year-round. To house construction workers while the road was going in, Yutan purchased three junked buses, outfitted each with bunks and a simple barrel stove, and skidded them into the wilderness behind a D-9 Caterpillar. The project was halted in 1963: some fifty miles of road were eventually built, but no bridges were ever erected over the many rivers it transected, and the route was shortly rendered impassable by thawing permafrost and seasonal floods. Yutan hauled two of the buses back to the highway.</p>\r\n<p>The third bus was left about halfway out the trail to serve as backcountry shelter for hunters and trappers. In the three decades since construction ended, much of the roadbed has been obliterated by washouts, brush, and beaver ponds, but the bus is still there. A vintage International Harvester from the 1940s, the derelict vehicle is located twenty-five miles west of Healy as the raven flies, rusting incongruously in the fireweed beside the Stampede Trail, just beyond the boundary of Denali National Park. The engine is gone. Several windows are cracked or missing altogether, and broken whiskey bottles litter the floor. The green-and-white paint is badly oxidized. Weathered lettering indicates that the old machine was once part of the Fairbanks City Transit System: bus 142. These days it isn&rsquo;t unusual for six or seven months to pass without the bus seeing a human visitor, but in early September 1992, six people in three separate parties happened to visit the remote vehicle on the same afternoon. In 1980, Denali National Park was expanded to include the Kantishna Hills and the northernmost cordillera of the Outer Range, but a parcel of low terrain within the new park acreage was omitted: a long arm of land known as the Wolf Townships, which encompasses the first half of the Stampede Trail. Because this seven-by-twenty-mile tract is surrounded on three sides by the protected acreage of the national park, it harbors more than its share of wolf, bear, caribou, moose, and other game, a local secret that&rsquo;s jealously guarded by those hunters and trappers who are aware of the anomaly. As soon as moose season opens in the fall, a handful of hunters typically pays a visit to the old bus, which sits beside the Sushana River at the westernmost end of the nonpark tract, within two miles of the park boundary.</p>\r\n<p>Ken Thompson, the owner of an Anchorage auto-body shop, Gordon Samel, his employee, and their friend Ferdie Swanson, a construction worker, set out for the bus on September 6, 1992, stalking moose. It isn&rsquo;t an easy place to reach. About ten miles past the end of the improved road the Stampede Trail crosses the Teklanika River, a fast, icy stream whose waters are opaque with glacial till. The trail comes down to the riverbank just upstream from a narrow gorge, through which the Teklanika surges in a boil of white water. The prospect of fording this /affe-colored torrent discourages most people from traveling any farther. Thompson, Samel, and Swanson, however, are contumacious Alaskans with a special fondness for driving motor vehicles where motor vehicles aren&rsquo;t really designed to be driven.</p>\r\n<p>Upon arriving at the Teklanika, they scouted the banks until they located a wide, braided section with relatively shallow channels, and then they steered headlong into the flood. &ldquo;I went first,&rdquo; Thompson says. &ldquo;The river was probably seventy-five feet across and real swift. My rig is a jacked-up eighty-two Dodge four by four with thirty-eight-inch rubber on it, and the water was right up to the hood. At one point I didn&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;d get across. Gordon has a eight-thousand-pound winch on the front of his rig; I had him follow right behind so he could pull me out if I went out of sight.&rdquo; Thompson made it to the far bank without incident, followed by Samel and Swanson in their trucks.</p>\r\n<p>In the beds of two of the pickups were light-weight allterrain vehicles: a three-wheeler and a four-wheeler. They parked the big rigs on a gravel bar, unloaded the ATVs, and continued toward the bus in the smaller, more maneuverable machines. A few hundred yards beyond the river the trail disappeared into a series of chest-deep beaver ponds. Undeterred, the three Alaskans dynamited the offending stick dams and drained the ponds. Then they motored onward, up a rocky creek bed and through dense alder thickets. It was late afternoon by the time they finally arrived at the bus. When they got there, according to Thompson, they found &ldquo;a guy and a girl from Anchorage standing fifty feet away, looking kinda spooked.&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>', '2019-07-04 16:34:49', 1),
(69, 'CHAP 3 - CARTHAGE ', '<p><em>/ wanted movement and not a calm course of existence. I wanted excitement and danger and the chance to sacrifice myself for my love.

Stately rows of cottonwoods shade a grid of streets seldom disturbed by moving vehicles. There&rsquo;s one grocery in town, one bank, a single gas station, a lone bar&mdash;the Cabaret, where Wayne Westerberg is sipping a cocktail and chewing on a sweet cigar, remembering the odd young man he knew as Alex.</p>\r\n<p>The Cabaret&rsquo;s plywood-paneled walls are hung with deer antlers, Old Milwaukee beer promos, and mawkish paintings of game birds taking flight. Tendrils of cigarette smoke rise from clumps of farmers in overalls and dusty feed caps, their tired faces as grimy as coal miners&rsquo;. Speaking in short, matterof-fact phrases, they worry aloud over the fickle weather and fields of sunflowers still too wet to cut, while above their heads Ross Perot s sneering visage flickers across a silent television screen. In eight days the nation will elect Bill Clinton president. It&rsquo;s been nearly two months now since the body of Chris McCandless turned up in Alaska. &ldquo;These are what Alex used to drink,&rdquo; says Westerberg with a frown, swirling the ice in his White Russian. &ldquo;He used to sit right there at the end of the bar and tell us these amazing stories of his travels. He could talk for hours. A lot of folks here in town got pretty attached to old Alex. Kind of a strange deal what happened to him.&rdquo; Westerberg, a hyperkinetic man with thick shoulders and a black goatee, owns a grain elevator in Carthage and another one a few miles out of town but spends every summer running a custom combine crew that follows the harvest from Texas north to the Canadian border.</p>\r\n<p>In the fall of 1990, he was wrapping up the season in north-central Montana, cutting barley for Coors and AnheuserBusch. On the afternoon of September 10, driving out of Cut Bank after buying some parts for a malfunctioning combine, he pulled over for a hitchhiker, an amiable kid who said his name was Alex McCandless. McCandless was smallish with the hard, stringy physique of an itinerant laborer. There was something arresting about the youngster&rsquo;s eyes. Dark and emotive, they suggested a trace of exotic blood in his heritage&mdash;Greek, maybe, or Chippewa&mdash;and conveyed a vulnerability that made Westerberg want to take the kid under his wing. He had the kind of sensitive good looks that women made a big fuss over, Westerberg imagined. His face had a strange elasticity: It would be slack and expressionless one minute, only to twist suddenly into a gaping, oversize grin that distorted his features and exposed a mouthful of horsy teeth. He was nearsighted and wore steel-rimmed glasses.</p>\r\n<p>He looked hungry. Ten minutes after picking up McCandless, Westerberg stopped in the town of Ethridge to deliver a package to a friend. &ldquo;He offered us both a beer,&rdquo; says Westerberg, &ldquo;and asked Alex how long it&rsquo;d been since he ate. Alex allowed how it&rsquo;d been a couple of days. Said he&rsquo;d kind of run out of money.&rdquo; Overhearing this, the friend s wife insisted on cooking Alex a big dinner, which he wolfed down, and then he fell asleep at the table. McCandless had told Westerberg that his destination was Saco Hot Springs, 240 miles to the east on U.S. Highway 2, a place he&rsquo;d heard about from some &ldquo;rubber tramps&rdquo; (i.e., vagabonds who owned a vehicle; as distinguished from &ldquo;leather tramps,&rdquo; who lacked personal transportation and were thus forced to hitchhike or walk).</p>\r\n<p>Westerberg had replied that he could take McCandless only ten miles down the road, at which point he would be turning north toward Sunburst, where he kept a trailer near the fields he was cutting. By the time Westerberg steered over to the shoulder to drop McCandless off, it was ten-thirty at night and raining hard. &ldquo;Jeeze,&rdquo; Westerberg told him, &ldquo;I hate to leave you out here in the goddamn rain. You got a sleeping bag&mdash;why don&rsquo;t you come on up to Sunburst, spend the night in the trailer?&rdquo; McCandless stayed with Westerberg for three days, riding out with his crew each morning as the workers piloted their lumbering machines across the ocean of ripe blond grain. Before McCandless and Westerberg went their separate ways, Westerberg told the young man to look him up in Carthage if he ever needed a job. &ldquo;Was only a couple of weeks that went by before Alex showed up in town,&rdquo; Westerberg remembers. He gave McCandless employment at the grain elevator and rented him a cheap room in one of the two houses he owned. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve given jobs to lots of hitchhikers over the years,&rdquo; says Westerberg. &ldquo;Most of them weren&rsquo;t much good, didn&rsquo;t really want to work. It was a different story with Alex. He was the hardest worker I&rsquo;ve ever seen. Didn&rsquo;t matter what it was, he&rsquo;d do it: hard physical labor, mucking rotten grain and dead rats out of the bottom of the hole&mdash;jobs where you&rsquo;d get so damn dirty you couldn&rsquo;t even tell what you looked like at the end of the day. And he never quit in the middle of something. If he started a job, he&rsquo;d finish it. It was almost like a moral thing for him. He was what you&rsquo;d call extremely ethical. He set pretty high standards for himself.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>', '2019-07-04 16:36:12', 1),
